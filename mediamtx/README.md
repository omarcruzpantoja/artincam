## MediaMTX

Why? MediaMTX is utilized to create the RTSP stream which kerberos can use to get live view.

Note: we first need to update the config ( mediamtx.yaml ) to have the correct pathing for the camera.py file. This might change, we may make it more smooth when setting up the entire project.

### Setup

You can do it the "easy" way and use the script for setup

```bash
chmod +x mediamtx-setup.sh
sudo mediamtx-setup.sh
```

Alternatively you can do it step by step

```bash
# create temporary directory
tmp=tmp-mediamtx
user=$(whoami)

# create directory
mkdir ${tmp}

# change working directory to the tmp directory
cd ${tmp}

# download file from internet
wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/download/v1.11.3/mediamtx_v1.11.3_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz

# decompress it and delete file
tar -xvzf mediamtx_v1.11.3_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz &
rm mediamtx_v1.11.3_linux_arm64v8.tar.gz

# Create a copy of the configuration
cp ../mediamtx.yml mediamtx.yml

# Move file to binary (executable files)
sudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/
# Give the executable file permission to run
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mediamtx

# Move config file to where configuration files live
# first create directory to store yaml
sudo mkdir -p /etc/mediamtx
# move the config file
sudo mv mediamtx.yml /etc/mediamtx/
```

Up until here you should be able to now run mediamtx as an executable with `mediamtx /etc/mediamtx.yml`. Note: this command requieres the configuration file path to be provided

If you wish to run MediaMTX as a servioce, use the following command

```bash
# set mediamtx as a systemd service (this will help with turning it on/off)
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/mediamtx.service >/dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=MediaMTX Streaming Server
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mediamtx /etc/mediamtx/mediamtx.yml
Restart=always
User=${user}
Group=${user}
WorkingDirectory=/home/${user}
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mediamtx
sudo systemctl start mediamtx

```

After this mediamtx should be running and you can verify its status with `sudo systemctl status mediamtx`.

Additionally you can stop the service with `sudo systemctl stop mediamtx` or restart it with `sudo systemctl restart mediamtx` .
